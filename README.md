# Pobability Blackjack
## A CLI Blackjack game that allows the player to view probabilities of different outcomes. Made with Python.

I thought it would be a fun challenge to create a simple blackjack game utilizing the command line as an
          interface. By turning
          "Probability Mode" on, this enhanced version of the game allows the player to see the odds. The percentages displayed represent an estimate of the chances of blackjack or bust outcomes and are updated in real time as cards are drawn. The dealer follows standard Vegas rules and will hit on 16 or 
          less and stand on 17 or higher.
